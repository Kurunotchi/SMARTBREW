# SMARTBREW
This is the code for SmartBrew: The autonomous coffee maker using IOT.

I am Kurunotchi taking a Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Fullbright College. 

This is the project for engineering robotics and I am trying to connect it to Internet using ESP8266/Wemos D1 R2, but this Code is running in Arduino Uno and when I uploaded it into my Wemos D1 R2 board, it didn't work. Yes, I remove that single line in the ESP8266 library and other that are connected to the code of ESP8266 library.
